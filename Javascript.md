### **Day 2: Control Structures**
- **Concepts:**
  - Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`)
  - Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- **Topics to cover:**
  - Loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`)
  - Break and continue statements
- **Practice:**
  - Write a number guessing game using loops and conditionals.
  - Print multiplication table using loops.

### **Day 3: Functions**
- **Concepts:**
  - Declaring functions (`function` keyword, arrow functions)
  - Function parameters and return values
  - Function expressions
- **Topics to cover:**
  - Scope (global vs local)
  - Higher-order functions
  - IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
- **Practice:**
  - Build a function to calculate the factorial of a number.
  - Write a higher-order function to filter even numbers from an array.

---

### **Day 4: Objects & Arrays**
- **Concepts:**
  - JavaScript objects (key-value pairs)
  - Creating, accessing, and modifying objects
  - Arrays: creating, accessing, modifying elements
- **Topics to cover:**
  - Array methods (`push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`, `slice()`, `splice()`, `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`)
  - Object methods (`Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, `Object.entries()`)
- **Practice:**
  - Create an array of objects to store user information.
  - Implement an array filter to find objects based on user age.

---

### **Day 5: DOM Manipulation**
- **Concepts:**
  - What is the DOM (Document Object Model)?
  - Selecting elements in the DOM (`getElementById`, `querySelector`)
  - Manipulating elements (innerHTML, textContent, styles)
- **Topics to cover:**
  - Adding and removing elements
  - Handling events (click, hover, etc.)
  - Event delegation
- **Practice:**
  - Create a simple webpage where clicking a button changes the text and background color.
  - Build a to-do list where users can add and remove items.

---

### **Day 6: Advanced Functions and Closures**
- **Concepts:**
  - Closures and lexical scope
  - Callback functions
  - `this` keyword in different contexts
- **Topics to cover:**
  - Arrow functions and lexical binding of `this`
  - Function currying
  - Memoization
- **Practice:**
  - Create a simple counter using closures.
  - Implement a memoized function for Fibonacci sequence.

---

### **Day 7: Asynchronous JavaScript**
- **Concepts:**
  - Synchronous vs Asynchronous code
  - Callbacks, Promises, and `async/await`
- **Topics to cover:**
  - `setTimeout()`, `setInterval()`
  - Fetching data with `fetch()` and working with APIs
  - Error handling in async code (`try...catch`)
- **Practice:**
  - Build a webpage that fetches and displays data from an API (e.g., a weather API).
  - Implement a function that simulates a network request using `setTimeout()` and Promises.

---

### **Day 8: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Concepts:**
  - Introduction to OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
  - Classes and objects
  - Constructor functions
- **Topics to cover:**
  - Inheritance using `extends` and `super()`
  - Prototypes and prototype inheritance
  - Method overriding
- **Practice:**
  - Create a class `Person` and extend it to a class `Student`.
  - Build a class-based implementation of a simple shopping cart.

---

### **Day 9: Error Handling and Debugging**
- **Concepts:**
  - Try, catch, finally
  - Throwing custom errors
- **Topics to cover:**
  - Debugging with `console` and breakpoints in browser developer tools
  - Common JavaScript errors (syntax, type, reference)
  - Defensive programming
- **Practice:**
  - Create a script that validates form inputs and throws custom errors.
  - Debug a faulty script using browser dev tools.

---

### **Day 10: Advanced Topics and Best Practices**
- **Concepts:**
  - ES6+ features (destructuring, template literals, spread/rest operators)
  - Modules (`import` and `export`)
  - Web storage (localStorage, sessionStorage)
- **Topics to cover:**
  - Regular expressions
  - Performance optimization tips
  - Clean code and best practices
- **Practice:**
  - Implement a module-based JavaScript project with multiple files.
  - Build a small project (e.g., a note-taking app) that uses localStorage.

---

### **Final Project:**
- Create a complete JavaScript application (choose from one of the below or come up with your own idea):
  - A weather app that fetches data from an API and displays current weather for a location.
  - A personal portfolio with dynamic content loading using JavaScript.
  - A simple e-commerce site with product listing, cart, and order summary.
